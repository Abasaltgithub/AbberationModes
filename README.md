## About

The AberrationModes repository is dedicated to Zernike modes, a set of orthogonal polynomial functions used in optics to describe aberrations in optical systems. This repository provides Python code for generating and visualizing Zernike modes, making it a valuable resource for those interested in optics, wavefront analysis, or anyone looking to understand and work with Zernike polynomials.

Key features of this repository include:

- Calculation of Zernike modes for various orders and frequencies.
- Visualization of Zernike modes using Matplotlib.
- Examples and usage documentation for easy integration into your projects.
