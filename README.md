## About

The AberrationModes repository is dedicated to Zernike modes, a set of orthogonal polynomial functions used in optics to describe aberrations in optical systems. This repository provides Python code for generating and visualizing Zernike modes, making it a valuable resource for those interested in optics, wavefront analysis, or anyone looking to understand and work with Zernike polynomials.

Key features of this repository include:

- Calculation of Zernike modes for various orders and frequencies.
- Visualization of Zernike modes using Matplotlib.
- Examples and usage documentation for easy integration into your projects.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abasaltgithub/AberrationModes.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

Now you're ready to use the Zernike mode generation and visualization tools.

---

## Usage

You can use the code in this repository to generate and visualize Zernike modes for various optical aberrations. The main script for generating Zernike modes is `zernike_modes.py`.

Example usage:

```python
# Import the necessary functions
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from zernike_modes import zernike

# Define your parameters
m = 2  # Radial order
n = 3  # Azimuthal order
rho = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
r, theta = np.meshgrid(rho, phi)

# Generate and visualize the Zernike mode
Z = zernike(m, n, r, theta)
plt.imshow(Z, cmap='RdBu', extent=(0, 1, 0, 2 * np.pi))
plt.title(f"Zernike Mode Z({m}, {n})")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

For more usage examples and details, refer to the `examples` directory and the documentation in the repository.
